        <p>My Domain is a student residence with a diverse mix of Tenants from various socio-cultural backgrounds. My Domain aims to provide a safe and secure community environment for all Tenants, which contributes to academic achievement whilst living in harmony together and being socially successful.</p>
        <p>A community functions properly when all members show respect for the rights, ideals, culture, religion and comfort of other Tenants and the staff who serve their community. Respect for property is also essential, whether personal effects or communal facilities are involved.</p>
        <p>The philosophy at My Domain is that the rights of individual Tenants should be respected. This includes the right to privacy, security and a healthy living environment. Individuals must accept responsibility for their actions and the consequences of their actions. Individual rights can only be upheld where they do not violate the rights of other individuals in the My Domain community in general.</p>
        <p>An atmosphere of mutual tolerance and regard is required.</p>

                <li>If the Tenant does not owe any money to the Landlord for any of the reasons mentioned in clause 3.1, the total deposit plus two percent (2%) interest earned annually will be refunded when the Tenant leaves My Domain at the end of his Lease Period. If there are no damages caused by the Tenant the deposit plus interest as aforesaid will be refunded within seven (7) days after the Lease Period ends. If there are damages caused to the Unit during the Lease Period and/or by the Tenant the deposit plus interest as aforesaid minus repair costs will be refunded. The Landlord will provide the Tenant with receipts to prove the amount(s) spent on repairs. This will be done between fourteen (14) and twenty one (21) days after My Domain Management has done the outgoing inspection with the Tenant or after the damages are repaired.</li>
                <li>If the Tenant cancels the Lease Agreement with the Landlord and informs the Landlord that they will no longer be staying in the Unit, at any time before the end of the Lease Period, for any reason whatsoever, the Landlord may charge the Tenant a penalty fee for early termination of the Lease Agreement. The penalty fee will amount to a maximum charge of two (2) months of the rental amount which the Tenant pays to the Landlord at the time that the Tenant cancels the Lease Agreement. For example if the Tenant is paying R4, 200.00 for rent per month, the penalty fee for early cancellation will amount to a maximum of R8, 400.00.</li>
                <li>The deposit may be used by the Landlord to pay or pay a part of the penalty fee only if the Tenant does not owe any money to the Landlord for monthly rental or damages. If the Tenant does owe money to the Landlord as aforesaid then the Tenant will be liable to pay the full or part of the penalty fee to the Landlord out of their own pockets, depending on the extent of the damages to the Unit or the money owed to the Landlord for rental.</li>
                <li>If there is an increase in the monthly rental, the Tenant must pay extra towards the deposit so that the deposit is equal to two (2) months of the new monthly rental amount.</li>

                <li>The Tenant must set up a direct debit order or stop order or make an alternative payment plan to ensure his monthly rental is paid before the first (1st) day of each month.</li>
                <li>The Tenant is not allowed to pay a lower monthly rental amount for any reason.</li>
                <li>
                    If the Tenant pays the monthly rental in cash and if there are bank charges, he must pay for those charges.
                    <br>
                    If the monthly rental is not paid by 1st day of each month, the Tenant agrees to pay a late payment penalty fee of One Hundred Fifty Rand (R150.00) to the Landlord.
                    <br>
                    My Domain stresses the importance of paying rental on time. Failure to maintain a positive rental history will impact on the Tenant’s credit history. These days a good credit history is used for much more than just getting a credit card or a loan. Why? Let’s use the example of an irresponsible friend that always asks to borrow cash. If a person knows this irresponsible friend won’t pay it back on time, he won’t continue to let him borrow money.
                </li>
                <li>The monthly rental will increase by ten percent (10%) twelve (12) months after the Start Date of the Lease Agreement.</li>

            <div class="h4">OPTION TO RENEW THE LEASE AGREEMENT AFTER IT ENDS</div>
            My Domain Management will notify the Tenant at least two (2) months before the End Date of the following:
            <ol>
                <li>The End Date of the Lease Agreement.</li>
                <li>The new Lease Terms that will apply if the Tenant renews the Lease Agreement for a further fixed Lease Period.</li>

            </ol>
            <p>Notwithstanding the aforesaid, My Domain will send out a notice to all tenants in August or September requesting that Tenants indicate if they are already able to confirm their intention to renew the Lease Agreement for a further period after the End Date, and if not, requesting an indication of when they will be able to advise if they will be renewing their Lease Agreement or not. This is due to the Landlord’s need to start marketing Units which tenants intend to vacate after their Lease Period ends.</p>
            <p>Should the Tenant indicate that he/she does not intend to renew the Lease Agreement, the Landlord shall have the right of intermittent access to the Unit in order to ensure that the Unit will be ready for occupation by a new Tenant. For the Tenant’s peace of mind, the Landlord confirms that security will always be present during such periods of access.</p>

Upon vacating the Unit My Domain Management will do an outgoing inspection together with the Tenant. If the Tenant does not come to the inspection My Domain Management will inspect the Unit without him to see if there are any damages. If there are damages to the Unit part of, or the entire, deposit will be used as detailed in clause 3 above.</p>

            <div class="h4">LAUNDRY</div>
            <p>There is a laundry located on the first floor of My Domain and this is for Tenant use only.</p>
            <p>Out of respect for other Tenants, please keep the laundry clean and wipe out the machines after use. My Domain has environmentally friendly top-loading washing machines and dryers.

            <p>As a matter of courtesy, please empty machines promptly when their operating cycle has ended. If the Tenant is not present in the laundry when his clothes are washing / drying, he must leave a bag or basket on the top of the machine. This is a sign for other Tenants that he wants them to place his fully washed or dried clothes in that container awaiting his return.</p>
            <p>VERY IMPORTANT: Under no circumstances should any Tenant terminate another Tenant&rsquo;s machine cycle early or throw their clothes out of a machine.

            <div class="h4">CONSERVATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT</div>
            <p>My Domain is a community of over 460 Tenants. This means we leave a big footprint on the environment. We ask all Tenants to consider the impact of our significant energy usage and large output of waste products.</p>
            <p>Please adhere to the following basic principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take time to place cardboard and flattened cardboard packages, paper, juice and milk cartons, glass, plastic bottles and aluminum cans into the appropriate recycling bins.</li>
                <li>Only recyclable items should go in the recycling bins. To do otherwise contaminates the whole recycling program both here and at the waste depot. Do not contaminate the recycling with food or dirty items.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following does not belong in recycling:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Food scraps;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Clothing items;
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to the above, each Tenant must please consider the following energy saving practices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Turn off lights in the Unit when he is not in it ;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn off the lights in the laundry, study areas and entertainment areas if he is the last to leave; and

                <li>
                    Turn off electrical appliances when not in use (for example, even those little standby lights on the front of the TV use energy!).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="h4">SECURITY</div>
            <p>Each Tenant must ensure that his Unit is always locked, especially when left unattended (even if only to make a quick trip to the communal facilities). Unlocked doors encourage theft. Please also do not leave valuables such as laptops, wallets, keys and bicycles unsecured or unattended at any time.</p>
            <p>My Domain can take no responsibility for the security of personal items. Tenants are not permitted to give keys to non-tenants for access to their Unit. Units found left open whilst unattended will result in the door being closed and locked by the My Domain Building Manager.</p>
            <p>Tenants may not change any cylinder door lock to any door in My Domain.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="h4">PREVENTION OF THEFT</div>
            <p>My Domain strives to provide its Tenants with a safe and secure community environment. Unfortunately thieves exist in our society. Valuable equipment is stored in the communal areas so each Tenant must please ensure that he keeps exit doors closed to prevent outsiders from entering or damaging the My Domain premises or facilities.</p>

            <p>There are several ways in each Tenant can further increase his level of security:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ensure that his Unit is locked when he leaves;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not prop open fire doors;

                    Do not leave money or valuables in full view;
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>

            <div class="h4">FIRE ALARMS</div>
            <p>There are fire sensors in each Unit and the communal areas of My Domain.</p>
            <p>If a fire alarm sounds, Tenants are required to vacate their Units and move calmly to the fire exits, regardless of the inconvenience.

            <p>In the event of a fire or other incident where Tenant safety is endangered, Tenants are required to follow the instructions of My Domain staff members. Evacuation when required is compulsory for all Tenants. Please respect the efforts of the My Domain staff who are trying to help and do their job. Failure to evacuate a building during a fire alarm can result in a hefty fine imposed by the Cape Town Fire Department. Do not return to an evacuated room until instructed to do so by a My Domain staff member.</p>
            <p>NEVER ASSUME that a fire alarm is false. FIRE KILLS!</p>

        <li>
            <div class="h4">FALSE FIRE ALARMS</div>
            <p>Where the fire service is called out on a false alarm caused by the use of candles, incense, oil burners, pest / bug control bombs, toasters, cooking equipment or smoking in Units or the My Domain premises, or where deemed the fault of the Tenant&rsquo;s action, that Tenant will be responsible for the cost of the call out charged to My Domain by the fire service.</p>
            <p>Please note that where Tenants tamper with fire safety equipment in their Unit or the My Domain in the hope of hiding such activities, the Tenant will be fined Two Thousand Five Hundred Rand (R2 500.00) for misconduct. As this is a criminal offense, My Domain reserves the right to also lay criminal charges against the responsible Tenant and cancel the Tenant&rsquo;s Lease Agreement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="h4">FIRE EQUIPMENT</div>
            <p>Fire extinguishers are located in all My Domain hallways and communal areas. These are to be used for small fires only such as cooking fires where oil has ignited. Used fire blankets / extinguishers must be returned to the My Domain Building Manager for immediate replacement.</p>
            <p>Fire equipment that is not in working order jeopardizes the safety of all Tenants and My Domain Management will regularly be checking all fire equipment including fire extinguishers and hoses, fire alarm boxes, smoke detectors, exit signs and evacuation maps.</p>
            <p>It is against the law to tamper with fire equipment including removing or covering exit signs, damaging exit signs, altering the function of door closers, disabling or covering smoke detectors, discharging fire extinguishers for any purpose other than putting out a fire and doing anything that may compromise the proper functioning of fire equipment. Violators will be subject to substantial fines, criminal penalties and the termination of their Lease Agreement.</p>
            <p>Any fire equipment repair or replacement that results from Tenant misconduct will be charged to the Tenant(s) responsible. If the responsible party cannot be determined, the fine and related damage will be charged to all My Domain Tenants.</p>

        <li>
            <div class="h4">ELECTRICAL SAFETY</div>
            <p>Tenants are asked to ensure that all personal electrical appliances used at My Domain comply with South African Safety Standards. If the Tenant requires additional power points in his Unit, a power-board with an overload safety feature and surge protection should be used.</p>
            <p>To prevent overloading electrical circuits and to conserve energy, please limit electrical equipment in Units to such items as docks, irons, hair dryers / straighteners, curlers, shavers, lamps, computers and portable radios (no Hi-Fi&#39;s). These items must be maintained in good and clean operating condition. The cost to repair damage caused by any faulty appliance(s) and / or call out charges for electrical trappings caused by overloading electrical plugs will be charged to the Tenant. Cooking appliances, portable heaters, exercise equipment, air conditioners and other such items are PROHIBITED in Units.</p>
            <p>Tenants must comply with the following fire and safety policies which are intended to prevent injuries in My Domain and to ensure compliance with health and safety regulations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                   Never modify a plug by bending or removing the prongs;
                </li>
                <li>
                   Extension cords should only be used when necessary and do not &ldquo;daisy chain&rdquo; extension cords;
                </li>
                <li>
                   Large appliances are not permitted in rooms; and
                </li>
                <li>
                   Promptly replace frayed or damaged cords.
                </li>

        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="h4">ACCIDENT OR EMERGENCY</div>
            <p>With the exception of ambulance transport, it&rsquo;s the responsibility of the patient to arrange transportation to required medical services. In the event of an accident or emergency, please contact the My Domain Building Manager for help. Where transportation to medical services is required, it&rsquo;s the responsibility of the patient to pay for the associated costs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="h4">CONDUCT AND BEHAVIOUR</div>
            <p>Tenants are expected at all times to display mature, tolerant, courteous behavior and consideration for others. Tenants should act in such a way as to cause no offence, inconvenience, harm or disturbance to any other Tenant or My Domain employee. Furthermore, no Tenant should act in a manner which would bring My Domain into disrepute.</p>
            <p>Tenants of My Domain are responsible for ensuring that their guests also uphold the expected standards of behavior while visiting My Domain.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="h4">NOISE</div>
            <p>Tenants must be respectful of noise levels and considerate of the rights of others to sleep and study in peace. Noise that affects other Tenants&rsquo; ability to study, sleep or relax and is audible beyond an individual Unit is not acceptable at any time.</p>
            <p>As a general rule, there should be no disruptive noise after 10.00pm (22h00). Radios, stereos and musical instruments may only be used at reasonable hours of the day and will be restricted to a low level during quiet hours. Tenants are urged to use sound equipment with headphones where possible and avoid using excessive base where the thumping sound will transfer to neighboring Units. At any time of the day, a Tenant has the right to respectfully and politely ask people making excessive noise to stop and it&rsquo;s expected that reasonable requests will be accommodated immediately. Failure to comply may result in a fine of Two Hundred Fifty Rand (R250).</p>

            <div class="h4">HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION</div>
            <p>My Domain affirms that the right of all Tenants is to live free from harassment and discrimination of any kind, including harassment, ridicule or discrimination based on gender or sexual preference, race, religion, age, disability, nationality or marital status.</p>
            <p>Harassment or discrimination in any form is unacceptable and is illegal under South African Laws.</p>
            <p>Harassment is any form of behavior that causes offence and this can include comments and suggestions, leering, physical contact or explicit or implied demands. It also includes display of offensive images in posters, graffiti, movies or video footage. Harassment may occur unintentionally, but it&rsquo;s still harassment. It&rsquo;s unwelcome, uninvited and unreciprocated behavior. If the Tenant is harassed, he should not believe that he is to blame for someone else&rsquo;s unacceptable behavior. If the Tenant feels able, ask the person to stop. Sometimes the person may not be aware that their actions are causing the Tenant offence.</p>
